    <h2>1. Uploaded Files</h2>
    <p>Customers may upload STL or CAD files for quotation and printing. Files are reviewed for printability and compliance with our policies.</p>

    <h2>2. Retention</h2>
    <p>Files are stored securely for up to 29 days after order completion, then deleted. Files may be retained slightly longer for technical troubleshooting only if essential under legitimate interest. Customers will be notified. This does not affect your rights to data deletion.</p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of any designs you submit. Axis3D will not share or reuse your files except as necessary to complete your order.</p>

    <h2>4. Showcasing Work</h2>
    <p>We may display images of finished prints for portfolio or social media use, without disclosing proprietary design details or personal information. You may email info.axis3d@gmail.com to revoke consent for us to publish photos of your print. We will never publish STL, CAD, or similar files without explicit consent.</p>
